    <p>The story of the day:</p>
    <pre>
        A term referenced in this section of the text book caught my attention, mainly because I was unfamiliar with the term.
        “Web beacon” or Web bug is a 1 pixel by 1 pixel image injected into a Web site or e-mail for
        the sole purpose of tracking the consumer. After reading the definition, my first thought was
        how can an image be used to track someone? Also, is it detectable and if so how? Genius in its simplicity,
        think about what it takes to display an image on a web page or an e-mail, a HTML image tag with a source attribute
        equating to a URL, very simple code. When that image is referenced during the page loading process, the vendor knows
        who you are. The URL might contain some identifying number that associates a client with some kind of historical data.
        To detect if your e-mail has a Web beacon, just do a view source and see if there are any image links on the page.
        This process didn’t always have a nefarious intent, I think it was used by legitimate companies to monitor the efficacy
        of their e-mail marketing campaigns. A vendor like Barnes and Noble might send their customers e-mails with coupons
        and the company wanted to know how many people were opening their e-mails. A new process or technological solution
        to a specific concern morphed into a routine tracking method. That is what worries me about the internet.
